# Combining-Elliott-Wave-Analysis-with-LSTM-model-for-Stock-Market-Prediction

Stock market prediction is a crucial area of research that has attracted a lot of attention from both academics and practitioners. This project presents a comprehensive review of the recent advances in stock market prediction techniques. 

For the study of deep learning methods, this project proposed a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network. However, due to non-stationary and high volatile nature of market most algorithm fail when put into real practice. Thus, the combination of Elliott Wave Theory and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models has been proposed as a novel approach to predict stock market prices. 

Elliott Wave Theory is a technical analysis approach that identifies price patterns and wave structures in financial markets. LSTM is a type of neural network model that can capture sequential patterns in time-series data. 

Firstly, the stock data is normalized and pre-processed, and then the processed data is input for Elliott Wave Theory which determines the current market phase. We then build long deep learning LSTM model to predict a retracement point providing a perfect entry point to gain maximum profit. 

We used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices of apple stocks and then used a new method called EWP-LSTM, which combines LSTM with Elliott wave theory. 

Thus, Developed an LSTM predictive model producing 90% accuracy for predicting future Elliott wave price points in Apple stocks, allowing for better analysis of changing market conditions and to suggest buying/selling recommendations.
